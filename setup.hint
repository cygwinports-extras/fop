sdesc: "XSL-FO to PDF formatter"
ldesc: "Apache FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by XSL 
formatting objects. It is a Java application that reads a formatting 
object tree conforming to the XSL 1.1 Recommendation and then turns it 
into a PDF document, certain other output formats or allows you to 
preview it directly on screen. Some parts of the XSL 1.1 specification 
have also been implemented."
